Subject: SODEXO decisIons

Feedback: I read the foIIowIng off :of your FAQs with some interest since I feel SODEXO Is making many
bad decisions that affect everyone who Is paying attehtion and there are more than a few 0f us that do
sol . . ., . V. . . . , I =

(U) What were the results of'th'e latest cafeterIa-survey?

F-S continues working with S'o'dé'x‘o' t'o re'V'Italiiz‘ethe food services prog ram. The survey re’su‘lts indicated,
that customers desired greater variety, improved quality, better value, nutrition Infomation and smaller
portion sized options. In direct response to the survey resuIts Sodexo Introduced an enhanced' '_grab and
go" In November 2008 and a Subway restaurant kiosk In the HeadCIuarters cafeteria In summer 2009

While I can appreciate the greater variety SODEXO is offering, there Is no reason for them to arbitrarily
decide to no longer offer products apparentiy based on "their decision“ that it- is not heaithy. Who do they
think they are? Where does that stop? Will we all eventualiy have to waIk through the cafeteria Iine like
school kids with no choice of what to eat? That is what it certainly appears to many of us We are aduits,
we can certainiy make our own Informed deci'sions on what to eat We Sure as hell do not need others té
make that decision for us regardless of “Intent. If one wants to eat something not good for them, that is
their choice, not SODEXO‘ s. I firmly believe they have been here Iong enough and it Is long past time for
a change The Agency NEEDS to ﬁnd a different food services caterer — I say let‘s go back to GSI, they
knew how to take gbod care of people, SODEXO SUCKS!!!

garbage management costs oyerall.

Increasing numbers of iocal", véteran- -0wned businesses are diverting that waste stream into usable

Feedback: I nOtICed that the mithtion inforr'na‘tio’h cards fbr the "c‘ookéd vegetables in the hot part of the
saiiiad bar are incorrect They appear to reﬂect the nutrition content of the vegetables as if they were
served raw, but don' t take into account their method of preparation, which involves cooking them in either
oil or butter. .FOr example, there' 5 no way they have 0g of fat, when I can cieariy see the oiI/butter pooiing
at the bottom of the dish. Wouid it be possible to eStImat'e' the amount of fat caldries, etc, of the
vegetables post-cqciking? Or at least prOvide a note that indicates how they Ve been prepared (for
exampie, -I would like to know if they' ve been made using butter vs. vegetable oil, because there' 5 a huge

difference in the level of heaithiness. )

Icashi'ers wiII eventuaIly get Quicker when ringing up dur orders, the new FreedomPay readers, while smaI.,.I

are MUCH leWer t‘o re'ac't Plas, we can't see dur balance Without.- asking the Cashier. Kinda negates the

encountered bagels that were not- fully thawed and therefore could not be sliced in the sheer without
crushing them. So I went for bread to have some toast. The bread drawers were mostly empty and what
bread that was there was moldy Then went to the Oatmeal, Which was as thick as partia'ily dried
cement Tried the Cream of Wheat, and it tasted as If it was burnt. I was thoroughly disgusted at this
point and Ieft. This isn t a one time occurrence either Frequently, food is not out on time, eggs are
always water logged (I want to pay for eggs, not water when I am being charged by weight), bageis are
always freezer burned when thawed one register to serve a building with 7 floors, the hot bar is a miss-
mash of items that frequently are not served together, nothing is fresh. .i. e. you can easily tell it' s all
frozen food the prices are astronomicai on weighed food (especially taking quality into consideration We
can go to numerous places off compound and receive high quaIity food and service for half the cost), the
cafeteria is clearly understaffed and there appears to be zero management (at least quality
management) The place I's absolutely disgtlsting This isn 't a|:]issu”e either, Its a So‘déxo issue. Take (b)(3)

It is typical business practice In the food industry to make your customers aware of any substitutions. The
CustOme'r- should be TOLD before ordering and paying The price should also reﬂect the poorer quaiity.

I am sure I wI’I‘I not be the only ohe compiainihg about the DD hash browns today. Not to be dramatic, DD
hash browns-are'the crowning glory‘of a DD breakfast!

cab someone please IGOR into this‘? I nor ”anyone else shouId over pay ferra lesser quality'substitution, ”nor
should they be surprised that this occurred in the first place once they open the bag.

 

"Thanks
